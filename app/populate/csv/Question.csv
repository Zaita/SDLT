As part of your submission, the SDLT will calculate the potential maximum level of risk your deliverable poses to the NZ Agency. This task will ask you to identify the data/information and systems that your deliverable interacts with. As there is no correlation between the size of a change and the level of risk introduced, the NZ Agency has classified it's systems and data against predetermined potential risk impact levels. 

The impact ratings defined by this approach will be more accurate than the previous manual approach. Because of this, you should expect to see higher initial risk impact ratings than previously. The SDLT's Digital Security Risk Assessment process will allow you to reduce the risk to the Agency by providing a set of controls that will automatically.","action","0","108","51"
