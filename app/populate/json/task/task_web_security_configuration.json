        "description": "<p>As a Government Agency, the Transport Agency must ensure web facing services and websites have been configured to security standards in line with the New Zealand Information Security Manual. Requirements outlined by the Government Communication Security Bureau (GCSB) can be easily configured and verified with the right tools.<\/p><p>This task will get you to verify your Encryption and Security configurations by using openly available and free tools. These checks can be done by any person(s) technical, or not. Both websites provide information on how to quickly and easily remediate any findings. Your web facing services must achieve an 'A' or 'A+' rating on both websites.<\/p><p>The first site, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ssllabs.com\/ssltest\/\">Qualys's SSL Labs<\/a> will check the configuration of your encryption setup. This check will take approximately two minutes to complete against your website and provide immediate results.<\/p><p>The second site, <a href=\"https:\/\/securityheaders.com\/\">Security Headers<\/a> will check what security options have been configured on your web server to protect customers from potential attacks and hi-jacks. This check will take approximately 30 seconds to complete.<\/p><p>Please feel free to run these checks against testing, staging, pre-production and production environments to ensure all of your environments are safe.<\/p><p>If you have any questions about this, please reach out to the Transport Agencies Security Architecture team (security.architects@nzta.govt.nz).<\/p>",
