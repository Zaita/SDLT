# The SDLT
The SDLT, previously the Security Development Lifecycle Tool, is a web application tool that serves as a self-service entry point for following a quality assurance lifecycle process. This tool collects relevant information about a delivery, determines the risk rating and generates the appropriate requirements. The tool tailors the list of requirements to the projects specific needs, without providing unnecessary unrelated requitements. The process is derived from a security centric perspective, allowing the security teams and other stakeholders (e.g., privacy, data, finance) to establish custom guidance and requirements as checklist items for all deliveries.

The SDLT is used as a guide and reference for deliverying high quality outcomes, be they software release or entire projects. This encourages a security mindset among project teams and can be used to easily track the completion of requirements for the project.

The SDLT is a no-code solution, allowing quick and easy deployment of workflows that support organisational delivery processes. You can be up and running in a few minutes with the pre-configured work-flows.

The tool comes pre-configured with:
- Basic workflows to illustrate common scenarios
- Tasks covering basic concerns like privacy, security and data management
- Built in approval flows with delegation ability
- Digital security risk assessment capability
- Control validation audit capability
- Certification and accreditation capability
- Service inventory module for certification and accreditation
- Usage Reporting

## This Fork
This fork is now the primarily repository for the SDLT.

The SDLT was previously developed by The New Zealand Transport Agency (Waka Kotahi), but they have now abandoned the project. This fork is to continue development of new functionality while ensuring the product remains open source.

## Getting Help or Hosting
