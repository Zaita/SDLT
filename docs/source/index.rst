What is the SDLT?
================================
The SDLT is a web application tool that serves as a self-service entry point for following a quality assurance lifecycle process. This tool collects relevant information about a delivery, determines the risk rating and generates the appropriate requirements. The tool tailors the list of requirements to the projects specific needs, without providing unnecessary unrelated requitements. The process is derived from a security centric perspective, allowing the security teams and other stakeholders (e.g., privacy, data, finance) to establish custom guidance and requirements as checklist items for all deliveries.

The SDLT is used as a guide and reference for deliverying secure outcomes, be they software release or entire projects. This encourages a security mindset among project teams and can be used to easily track the completion of requirements for the project.
